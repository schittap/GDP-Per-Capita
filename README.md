# GDP-Per-Capita
I was the team lead for the 2024-25 UCLA Bruin Reserve Bank Group 3 research project. Since our paper read like a literature/humanities review, I went back and supplemented discussion of the topic after our midpoint and final presentations through data visualization with tidyverse (<https://schittap.github.io/GDP-Per-Capita/>).
